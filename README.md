# tracking-sanity
This repository helps you study visual tracking (single & generic object tracking) by taking a close look at recent datasets and trackers.

## Datasets
Tracking datasets out there are huge, (often implicitly) different in format and not always well-annotated, where you could easily lead yourself astray. Besides the brief summary below, we provide more details about the individual datasets in [Datasets.md](Datasets.md).

## Trackers
A fair comparison is often hard because people train, test or evaluate their trackers in different ways. Here, we not only keep track of the state-of-the-art but also try to clarify the way the results are produced, based on public papers and code. More details will be provided in [Trackers.md](Trackers.md).
