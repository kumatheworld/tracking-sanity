# tracking-sanity
This repository helps you study visual tracking (single & generic object tracking) by taking a close look at recent datasets and trackers.

## Datasets
Tracking datasets out there are huge, (often implicitly) different in format and not always well-annotated, where you could easily lead yourself astray. In addition to the brief summary below, we provide more details about the individual datasets in [Datasets.md](Datasets.md).

## Trackers
Trackers out there are often trained, tested or evaluated in different ways, which makes a fair comparison hard. Here, we not only keep track of the state-of-the-art but also try to clarify the way the results are produced, based on public papers, code and discussion. More details will be provided in [Trackers.md](Trackers.md).
