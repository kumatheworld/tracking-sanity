### General caveats
* **Don't optimize your tracker using test sets**. Doing this is not a good idea in any machine learning field. However in visual tracking, the smallness of datasets and the sensitivity of metrics make it conceivable.
* Prepare well for the huge datasets!

## VOT [:globe_with_meridians:](https://www.votchallenge.net/) [:octocat:](https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit-python)
VOT (Visual Object Tracking) Challenge is a competition that has been held as a workshop of ICCV/ECCV every year since 2013. Besides its main [short-term challenges](#vot-short-term-challenges), [long-term challenges](#vot-long-term-challenges) and multimodal tracking challenges have taken place recently.
### Common Features
* Every dataset mostly consists of a **mixture of existing datasets**
* The datasets are carefully constructed and mostly recycled every year
* Small
### Common Caveats
* Since each dataset is made from existing datasets, **don't use them for training/tuning your tracker**.
### VOT Short-Term Challenges
#### Features
* Unique evaluation protocols and associated metrics of average overlap, robustness and expected average overlap (EAO, since `VOT2015`)
* The test sets sequestered completely (since `VOT2017`)
* Frame-level annotations of 5 attributes (occlusion, illumination change, motion change, size change, camera motion)
#### Statistics (of the public datasets, not of the sequestered datasets)

#### Used Datasets (partially uncertain)
* ??? for `VOT2013`
* [VOT2013](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2013/), [OTB2013](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/benchmark_v10.html), [ALOV](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6671560) for `VOT2014`
* [OTB2013](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/benchmark_v10.html), [ALOV](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6671560), [PTR](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38886-6_61) for `VOT2015` and `VOT2016`
* [OTB2013](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/benchmark_v10.html), [ALOV](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6671560), ??? for `VOT2017` and `VOT2018`
    * In the [VOT2018 paper](http://prints.vicos.si/publications/365), [NUS-PRO](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/lv/pro/nus_pro.html) was prohibited for learning, whereas PTR was not mentioned. Were some videos from PTR replaced with some NUS-PRO ones?
    * Note that [TempleColor128](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/data/TColor-128/TColor-128.html) is also prohibited for learning because it has some OTB videos.
* [OTB2013](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/benchmark_v10.html), [ALOV](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6671560), ???, [GOT-10k](#got-10k-tpami2019-globe_with_meridians-memo-octocat) after `VOT2019`
    * At most 15 GOT-10k videos are finally used for replacement but [1,000 videos](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/res/list0_prohibited_1000.txt) were prohibited for learning.
#### Caveats (Important!!)
* Research papers use the public sets for test since the true test sets are not available.
* The test results seem **very sensitive**.
    * See e.g. https://github.com/STVIR/pysot/discussions/94, https://github.com/visionml/pytracking/issues/79 or https://github.com/MegviiDetection/video_analyst/issues/109.
    * You might see ~30% performance changes in EAO with a small perturbation to few of your parameters.
    * Some people take adventage of this and **try to overfit the dataset** by tuning some hyperparameters.
        * See e.g. https://github.com/hqucv/siamban/issues/32 or https://github.com/zhanght021/RPT/issues/11.
### VOT Long-Term Challenges
#### Features
* Unique metrics of tracking precision, tracking recall and tracking F-score
* Video-level annotations of 9 attributes (full occlusion, out-of-view, partial occlusion, camera motion, fast motion, scale change, aspect ratio change, viewpoint change, similar objects)

#### Used Datasets
* [LTB35](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07056) for `VOT-LT2018`
    * Made from [UAV20L](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul/uav123) (20), [TLD](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231b_spring1415/papers/Kalal-PAMI.pdf) (3), some YouTube videos (6), and [AMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00089) (6).
* LTB50 after `VOT-LT2019`
    * The construction is not clear but seems a superset of [LTB35](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07056).

* Delimiters in `groundtruth_rect.txt` vary.
    * 68 videos use `','` and 32 videos use `'\t'`.
    * The 496th bounding box of `BlurCar1` is delimited by `' '` while the rest is delimited by ```'\t'```.
* The following 4 videos do not have `0001.jpg` unlike the rest.
    | Video    | First frame |

    | Board    |   00001.jpg |
* There are files whose purpose is obscure.
    * 48 directories out of the 98 have `cfg.mat`.
    * `Box` has `box.zip`.
    * `Human4` has empty `groundtruth_rect1.txt`.
    * `Panda` has `panda-all.txt`.
* There are bounding boxes sticking out of the FoV.
    * Examples:
        * The 75th bounding box `(348, -10, 32, 35)` of `Biker`
        * The 274th bounding box `(268, 60, 60, 83)` of `Trellis`, whose resolution is `320 x 240`
    * The coordinate origin is not clear for this reason.
* 2 videos have invalid bounding boxes at the very end.
    * The 698th bounding box `(0, 0, 0, 0)` of `Board`
    * The 472nd bounding box `(0, 0, 0, 0)` of `Twinnings`

### Caveats
* The 30fps version of `dog_2` seems nothing but `dog` rather than a downsampled version of the 240 fps video.
* In the following 10 videos, whether 240 FPS or 30 FPS, the annotation length is shorter than the video length by 1.
    * `Gymnastics`, `Skydiving`, `airtable_3`,  `basketball_2`, `beach_flipback_person`, `bowling_ball`, `motorcross`, `parkour`, `shuffletable_4`, `soccer_ball_2`.
* The coordinate origin seems 0.
    * All x-coordinates are within [0, width) and are y-coordinates are within [0, height), and there are many 0's.

## TrackingNet [ECCV2018] [:globe_with_meridians:](https://tracking-net.org/) [:memo:](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10794) [:octocat:](https://github.com/SilvioGiancola/TrackingNet-devkit)

* **Human annotations take up only ~3% and the rest is annotated by running trackers**
* Available for training
* Sequesters the test set annotations and provides an [evaluation server](http://eval.tracking-net.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/39/overview)
* Huge
* Short

    | TEST  |     511 |    225,589 |             34 |
### Caveats
* The dataset is **Huge**.
    * It is provided as multiple nested .zip files.
        * `TRAIN_{0..11}.zip` (~90GB each) and `TEST.zip` (34GB).
        * If you don't delete .zip files after extraction, you'll end up using over a **3TB** of space!
* Watch out for the "human annotations at 1 fps" feature!
    * Many bounding boxes are sticking out of the FoV.
        * See https://github.com/SilvioGiancola/TrackingNet-devkit/issues/23.
    * Human annotations do not happen every 30 frames exactly.
        * E.g. `TRAIN_0/A1RSx6j_ra0_4` seems to have human annotations at the following: `1, 31, 61, 91, ..., 451, 481, 510, 540`.
        * Is this because of the backward test?
* Image sequence format is `%d.jpg`, not like `%03d.jpg`.
    * That means you can't get the correct order just by sorting them (e.g. `10.jpg` comes before `1.jpg`). Use [natsort](https://natsort.readthedocs.io/en/master/) instead.

### Caveats
* If you evaluate your tracker on `VOT2019` or `VOT2020`, **you can't use some part of this dataset**.
    * See https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/res/list0_prohibited_1000.txt.
* There are neither 10K videos nor 1.5M frames in contrast to authors' claim.
* `Test` has only 180 videos, not 420 videos as the authors say.
* The frame resolution sometimes changes in a video.
    * See https://github.com/got-10k/toolkit/issues/25.
* There are at least 33 ill-annotated videos.
    * Examples:
        * ```
            $ head -5 train/GOT-10k_Train_004419/groundtruth.txt
            371.0000,0.0000,150.0000,0.0000
            352.0000,0.0000,157.0000,0.0000
            346.0000,0.0000,157.0000,0.0000
            333.0000,0.0000,138.0000,0.0000
            320.0000,0.0000,144.0000,0.0000
          ```
        * ```
            $ head -5 train/GOT-10k_Train_005996/groundtruth.txt
            1197.0000,86.0000,374.0000,548.0000
            1223.0000,38.0000,386.0000,89.0000
            1304.0000,0.0000,321.0000,1.0000
            1341.0000,0.0000,293.0000,1.0000
            1353.0000,0.0000,270.0000,1.0000
          ```
* The coordinate origin is not clear.
    * It is supposed to be 1 (see https://github.com/got-10k/toolkit/issues/6) but there are many videos (including 6 `Test` videos) that have `0`'s as the left end or the top end coordinate.
* Some `Train` videos and `Val` videos are made from the same YouTube videos.
    * 107 videos out of the 180 `Val` videos have some overlaps with `Train`.
        * E.g. `GOT-10k_Val_000002` is from `https://youtu.be/kjQGSiLvFac`, which `GOT-10k_Train_000147`, `GOT-10k_Train_000148` and `GOT-10k_Train_000149` are also made from.
    * Authors claim that `Val` is randomly sampled from `Train` but this is not true.
* Watch out for the statement "no overlap between `Train` and `Test`".
    * As is written in the paper, the `person` class shows up in both. The `person` videos are differentiated by motion class.
* [Leaderboard](http://got-10k.aitestunion.com/leaderboard) is fun to watch but...
    * Not sure if every tracker follows the protocol of "Train only on GOT-10k". Take the results with a grain of salt.
* You might not get the dataset link after sending a request with your e-mail address.
    * See https://github.com/got-10k/toolkit/issues/41.
    * I tried 2 different e-mail addresses but none of them worked.

## LaSOT-extension [IJCV2021] [:globe_with_meridians:](http://vision.cs.stonybrook.edu/~lasot/) [:memo:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03465) [:octocat:](https://github.com/HengLan/LaSOT_Evaluation_Toolkit)
**Note:** LaSOT-extension is not an official name and is considered part of [LaSOT](#lasot-cvpr2019-globe_with_meridians-memo-octocat).
### Features
* Extends LaSOT with 150 videos that have no class overlap with it
    * Again balanced class distribution (15 object classes x 10 videos/class)
    * The 15 classes don't have any overlap with ImageNet either
* Meant for one-shot evaluation
    * All the 1,400 videos of LaSOT are allowed to use for training
    * Is training on other datasets not banned?
* Test-only (not for training)
### Statistics
| #Videos |  #Frames | #Object <br> classes | #Attr. | Size <br> (GB) |
| ------: | -------: | -------------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|     150 |  359,169 |                   15 |     14 |             60 |
### Caveats
* The coordinate origin is not clear in contrast to the other LaSOT videos.
    * See https://github.com/HengLan/LaSOT_Evaluation_Toolkit/issues/14.

## TREK-100 [ArXiv2020] [:globe_with_meridians:](https://machinelearning.uniud.it/datasets/trek100/) [:memo:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12263)
### Features
* Made of first person vision videos of the [EPIC-KITCHENS-100](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2021) dataset
* Test-only
* Hard
* Small
### Statistics
| #Videos | #Frames | #Object <br> classes | #Attr. | Size <br> (GB) |
| ------: | ------: | -------------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|     100 |  60,054 |                   29 |     17 |            2.0 |
### Caveats
* Although it is small, the preparation process based on the provided code is a bit painful.
    * The dataset temporarily swells up to **hundreds of gigabytes**. This is because the dataset is constructed by trimming a whole bunch of large videos that you have to download. Only after downloading them all does the code ever delete those video files.
        * To get around this, you can modify the code to delete the videos as soon as the necessary frames are extracted.
* The coordinate origin seems 0.
    * All x-coordinates are within [0, width) and are y-coordinates are within [0, height), and there are many 0's.

## TNL-2k [CVPR2021] [:globe_with_meridians:](https://sites.google.com/view/langtrackbenchmark/) [:memo:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16746) [:octocat:](https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/TNL2K_evaluation_toolkit)
### Features
* Each video is given a short description in English that determines the target
    * This is different from [LaSOT](#lasot-cvpr2019-globe_with_meridians-memo-octocat) in that the description of a LaSOT video is not always descriptive enough to determine the target.
    * That gives us another way of determining the object identity.
        * For example, when the description is "The man holding the soccer ball" in a soccer game video, the target changes as soon as another man gets the ball from the current target.
* Contains thermal images
* Contains a lot of synthetic images from cartoons or games
* Available for training
